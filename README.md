**Chat¬≤GPT** is a [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) chat bot for Google Chat ü§ñüí¨. It's designed to amplify the experience in your Google Chat rooms by offering personalized user sessions for coherent dialogues, a manual reset capability, the power to generate images via OpenAI's [DALL¬∑E 2 API](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), and dynamic interactions through mentions or direct messaging. Moreover, with the integration of ElevenLabs' [Text-to-Speech API](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api-reference/text-to-speech), Chat¬≤GPT now brings voice interactions, letting users convert textual prompts into audio. User input and text output is moderated with OpenAI's [Moderation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation).

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

- **Dynamic Interactions:** Chat¬≤GPT is attentive to its surroundings. You can invoke it in chat rooms by directly mentioning it using `@botname`. Alternatively, for more private interactions or queries, you can send a direct message to the bot.

- **Interactive Sessions:** This bot remembers multiple rounds of a conversation per user, creating an illusion of continuous dialogue. It can even reference past questions or answers, mimicking a natural conversation flow.

- **Session Management:** To maintain efficient performance, each conversation is limited by a configurable setting, recommended at 5-10 turns. Moreover, the bot keeps an eye on the time since the last message, auto-resetting the session if a set time limit is surpassed. And if needed, users can manually reset their own session anytime with the `/reset` command.

- **Image Generation:** Want to visualize an idea? Use the `/image <prompt>` command. Based on the given prompt, which can range from a word to a paragraph, the bot leverages OpenAI's DALL¬∑E 2 API to generate a relevant image.

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Utilize the power of Eleven Labs TTS API with the `/tts <voice> <prompt>` command. This command will return a voice response based on the given prompt in the specified voice. To see a list of available voices, use the `/voices` command.

- **Optimized Performance:** We prioritize a smooth experience. Before processing any message, the bot checks its size by counting its tokens. If found too lengthy, an error message suggests the user to condense their message. This ensures uninterrupted bot interactions without straining the system.

- **Help On-Demand:** Have questions on how to use Chat¬≤GPT? Just type in the `/help` command. The bot fetches content directly from the `docs/usage.md` file, ensuring users get accurate, up-to-date information.

Remember, Chat¬≤GPT is flexible, suitable for deployment on Google Cloud, FaaS (Function as a Service), or PaaS (Platform as a Service) environments, ensuring it's a perfect fit for all your Google Chat endeavors.

### Commands ‚å®Ô∏è

Use the following commands for Chat¬≤GPT:

- `/reset`: Reinitialize your session.
- `/image <prompt>`: Generate an image using OpenAI's DALL¬∑E 2 API.
- `/tts <voice> <prompt>`: Get a voice response with ElevenLabs' TTS API.
- `/voices`: View available voices for TTS.
- `/help`: Access accurate, up-to-date information from the docs.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy

### Data Practices üìù

- **Ephemeral Conversations:** Chat¬≤GPT doesn't store or retain conversation history. Every session is temporary, ending when a conversation concludes or times out.

- **Temporary Audio Storage:** Audio files are stored temporarily in Google Cloud Storage to allow users enough time for downloading. To ensure data privacy and efficient storage utilization, these files are deleted with each app redeployment.

- **Reactive Responses:** The bot only reacts to direct prompts, such as @mentions or direct messages, and doesn't "read the room".

- **Anonymous Sessions:** Users are tracked using anonymous ID numbers solely for session consistency. These IDs are cleared with each app redeployment.

## AI APIs and User Awareness ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- **OpenAI's Commitment:** We use OpenAI's APIs, which, as per OpenAI's policy, don't use user inputs for model training. More details are on [OpenAI's official site](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).

- **ElevenLabs' Commitment:** We use ElevenLabs' APIs, which, as per ElevenLabs' policy, don't use user inputs for model training. More details are on [ElevenLabs' official site](https://elevenlabs.io/terms)).

- **User Awareness:** Discussing sensitive topics? Exercise caution, especially in group settings. Chat¬≤GPT doesn't log conversations, but your organization or platform might.
