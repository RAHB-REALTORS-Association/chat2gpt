**Chat¬≤GPT** is a ChatGPT chat bot for Google Chat ü§ñüí¨, designed to enhance communication and productivity in your Google Chat rooms. It acts as an intelligent and responsive virtual assistant, capable of providing relevant responses and information.

This bot maintains individual sessions for each user, tracking a turn count and Time-To-Live (TTL) limit. This functionality contributes to a more interactive and consistent conversation flow. Users can manually reset their session at any time using the `/reset` command, providing additional control over their interactions with the bot.

Chat¬≤GPT is designed to run on Google Cloud or your preferred FaaS (Function as a Service) or PaaS (Platform as a Service) environment, making it a flexible and adaptable tool for enhancing your Google Chat experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
[![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run?git_repo=https://github.com/RAHB-REALTORS-Association/chat2gpt)

This bot is intended to be deployed on Google Cloud Functions and its continuous deployment pipeline is managed using GitHub Actions.

Follow these steps to setup your Chat¬≤GPT bot:

**1. Clone the Repository üìÅ**

Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAHB-REALTORS-Association/chat2gpt.git
```

**2. Create Google Cloud Project ‚òÅÔ∏è**

Create a new project in your Google Cloud Console or select an existing one.

**3. Create a Service Account and JSON Key üìë**

In the Google Cloud Console:
- Navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".
- Click on "Create Service Account".
- Give your service account a name and description, then click "Create and Continue".
- Grant this service account the "Cloud Functions Developer" role (or any role that has the "cloudfunctions.functions.create" permission) to allow it to create and update Cloud 
Functions. If you plan to use other Google Cloud services, you might need to grant additional roles.
- Click "Continue" and then "Done".
- Click on the newly created service account from the list.
- Go to the "Keys" tab, click "Add Key" and select "Create new key".
- Choose "JSON" as the key type and click "Create". The JSON key file will be automatically downloaded to your local machine. This file contains the service account credentials that 
will be used by GitHub Actions for deploying your function. Be careful with this file as it provides admin access to your Google Cloud project.

**4. Set GitHub Secrets üîí**

In your GitHub repository:
- Navigate to "Settings" > "Secrets" > "New repository secret".
- Add the following secrets:
  - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud Project identifier.
  - `GCP_FUNCTION`: Your desired Google Cloud Function name.
  - `GCP_REGION`: Your chosen Google Cloud region.
  - `GCP_SA_KEY`: The entire JSON key file content that was downloaded in the previous step, encoded as base64.
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
  - `MODEL_NAME`: The name of the OpenAI model you're using. For this project, we recommend "gpt-3.5-turbo".
  - `SYSTEM_PROMPT`: The system prompt to use for the OpenAI API.
  - `MAX_TURNS`: This sets the maximum number of exchanges the bot remembers in a user session before resetting. Default: 10 exchanges.
  - `TTL`: This sets the duration (in seconds) a user session stays active from the last received message before it resets. Default: 600 seconds (10 minutes).
  - `MAX_TOKENS_INPUT`: This sets the maximum number of tokens that can be sent. Default: 2000 tokens.

**5. GitHub Actions üöÄ**

The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to automatically deploy the bot to Google Cloud Functions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository.

**6. Configure Bot Access ü§ù**

- Navigate to https://chat.google.com/u/0/botmanagement.
- Click on the bot you created.
- Under "Functionality", select "Bot works in...".
- Select "Spaces any user can create".
- Click "Save".

Now, your bot can be added to any room within your Google Workspace.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

Your bot is all set and ready for action! It's capable of interacting in any chat room, responding when directly mentioned (@botname), or when it receives a direct message, based on the functionality you've programmed. Our bot is designed to remember several rounds of a conversation per user session, providing a coherent and continuous interaction. This means you can ask a question, receive a response, and continue the conversation by referencing the initial query or its response.

However, for performance optimization, there are a few limitations in place. First, the length of the conversation is limited by a configurable setting; we recommend setting it to 5-10 turns. Each session also tracks the time since the last received message, automatically resetting if it exceeds a specified time limit. This ensures a seamless and efficient conversation experience with the bot.

Additionally, to ensure we don't overload the system with large messages, we've implemented a mechanism to count the tokens in a message before it's sent for processing. If the message is too large, the bot will respond with an error message asking the user to try a shorter message.

### Data Practices: üìù

-**Ephemeral Conversations:** Chat¬≤GPT doesn't store or retain conversation history. Every session is temporary, ending when a conversation concludes or times out.

-**Reactive Responses:** The bot only reacts to direct prompts, such as @mentions or direct messages, and doesn't "read the room".

-**Anonymous Sessions:** Users are tracked using anonymous ID numbers solely for session consistency. These IDs are cleared with each app redeployment.

### OpenAI and User Awareness: ‚ÑπÔ∏è

-**OpenAI's Commitment:** We use OpenAI's APIs, which, as per OpenAI's policy, don't use user inputs for model training. More details are on [OpenAI's official site](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).

-**User Awareness:** Discussing sensitive topics? Exercise caution, especially in group settings. Chat¬≤GPT doesn't log conversations, but your organization or platform might.
