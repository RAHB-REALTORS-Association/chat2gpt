## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to report it to us. There are two ways to report a vulnerability:

1. **GitHub**: Create a new issue in our GitHub repository, providing as much information as possible about the vulnerability. You can also use the new private disclosure option if appropriate.

2. **Contact Form**: Visit our website at https://www.rahb.ca/contact and fill out the contact form, selecting "Security Vulnerability" as the subject. Provide as much information as possible about the vulnerability.

Once a vulnerability report is received, our team will review and assess it. We will strive to keep you informed about the progress of your report, and you can generally expect an initial response within 48 hours. 

After our evaluation, we may:
- Accept the vulnerability report and work on a fix.
- Request more information or clarification about the vulnerability.
- Decline the report if it is determined not to be a security issue.

We appreciate your assistance in helping to keep our project secure. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to review and address it.
