# ðŸ‘· Development

The `server.py` script included in this repository serves as a lightweight, local development server for ChatÂ²GPT. This enables you to test new features, debug issues, or get a firsthand experience of the chatbot's capabilities without deploying it to a production environment. Running the server starts a web service that you can access at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
