# 🛡️ Privacy

## Data Practices: 📝

- **Ephemeral Conversations:** Chat²GPT doesn't store or retain conversation history. Every session is temporary, ending when a conversation concludes or times out.

- **Reactive Responses:** The bot only reacts to direct prompts, such as @mentions or direct messages, and doesn't "read the room".

- **Anonymous Sessions:** Users are tracked using anonymous ID numbers solely for session consistency. These IDs are cleared with each app redeployment.

## OpenAI and User Awareness: ℹ️

- **OpenAI's Commitment:** We use OpenAI's APIs, which, as per OpenAI's policy, don't use user inputs for model training. More details are on [OpenAI's official site](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).

- **User Awareness:** Discussing sensitive topics? Exercise caution, especially in group settings. Chat²GPT doesn't log conversations, but your organization or platform might.
