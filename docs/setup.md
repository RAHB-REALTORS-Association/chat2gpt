# üõ†Ô∏è Setup
[![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run?git_repo=https://github.com/RAHB-REALTORS-Association/chat2gpt)

This bot is intended to be deployed on Google Cloud Functions, with audio data temporarily stored in Google Cloud Storage. Its continuous deployment pipeline is managed using GitHub Actions.

Follow these steps to setup your Chat¬≤GPT bot:

**1. Clone the Repository üìÅ**

Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAHB-REALTORS-Association/chat2gpt.git
```

**2. Create Google Cloud Project ‚òÅÔ∏è**

Create a new project in your Google Cloud Console or select an existing one.

**3. Create a Service Account and JSON Key üìë**

In the Google Cloud Console:
- Head to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".
- Click "Create Service Account".
- Assign a name and description, then hit "Create and Continue".
- Grant this account the "Cloud Functions Developer" role for Cloud Functions creation and updating. If leveraging other Google Cloud services, additional roles may be required.
- Click "Continue" and then "Done".
- From the list, select the new service account.
- Under the "Keys" tab, choose "Add Key" > "Create new key".
- Opt for "JSON" as the key type and hit "Create". This auto-downloads the JSON key file to your device. This file, containing the service account credentials, facilitates GitHub Actions in deploying your function. Handle with caution.

When assigning roles to your service account:
- For the bot to read/write objects and metadata in the Cloud Storage bucket, grant the "Storage Object Admin" `(roles/storage.objectAdmin)` role.
- For the GitHub action to create and delete the bucket, grant the "Storage Admin" `(roles/storage.admin)` role.

**4. Set GitHub Secrets üîí**

In your GitHub repository:
- Navigate to "Settings" > "Secrets" > "New repository secret".
- Add the following secrets:
