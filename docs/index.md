**Chat²GPT** is a [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) chat bot for Google Chat 🤖💬. It's designed to amplify the experience in your Google Chat rooms by offering personalized user sessions for coherent dialogues, a manual reset capability, the power to generate images via OpenAI's [DALL·E 2 API](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), and dynamic interactions through mentions or direct messaging. Moreover, with the integration of ElevenLabs' [Text-to-Speech API](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api-reference/text-to-speech), Chat²GPT now brings voice interactions, letting users convert textual prompts into audio. User input and text output is moderated with OpenAI's [Moderation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation).
