**Chat²GPT** is a ChatGPT chat bot for Google Chat 🤖💬, designed to enhance communication and productivity in your Google Chat rooms. It acts as an intelligent and responsive virtual assistant, capable of providing relevant responses and information.

This bot maintains individual sessions for each user, tracking a turn count and Time-To-Live (TTL) limit. This functionality contributes to a more interactive and consistent conversation flow. Users can manually reset their session at any time using the `/reset` command, providing additional control over their interactions with the bot.

Chat²GPT can generate images using the OpenAI DALL·E 2 API using the `/image <prompt>` command. This command accepts a prompt as input and returns an image generated by the DALL·E model. The prompt can be a single word, a sentence, or a paragraph.

Chat²GPT is designed to run on Google Cloud or your preferred FaaS (Function as a Service) or PaaS (Platform as a Service) environment, making it a flexible and adaptable tool for enhancing your Google Chat experience.
